            In 2014, Moringa School launched its maiden Software Development class in Kenya with a cohort
            of only four (4) students and a vision for "A world in which anyone can create their future".
            At that time, there was a growing demand for skilled tech talent as companies increased investment in
            technology to gain a competitive advantage from their own digital transformation.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            Through the introduction of its 5-6 month Software Development, Data Science, Product Design,
            and Cyber Security Bootcamps, Moringa School embarked on a journey that would integrate over 7,000+
            learners from diverse backgrounds and experiences while channeling their motivation to learn and grow
            through market-aligned curriculum, a learning approach that simulates practical on-the-job-experience,
            and a vibrant community of employer partners, higher learning institutions, and other industry stakeholders.
            This approach ensured that graduating students were prepared to take up their rightful place in the digital
            economy evidenced by the EdTech leader's employment rate of 70% for all job-seeking alumni within 12 months.
